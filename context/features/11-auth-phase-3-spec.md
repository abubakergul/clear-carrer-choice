# Auth UI - Sign In, Register & Sign Out

## Overview

Replace NextAuth default pages with custom UI. Update user icon, email and username in bottom of sidebar. Use the coloring and design based on them and apply on button and layout for the page.

## Requirements

### Sign In Page (`/sign-in`)

- Email and password input fields
- "Sign in with Google" button
- Link to register page
- Form validation and error display

### Register Page (`/register`)

- Name, email, password, confirm password fields
- Form validation (passwords match, email format)
- Submit to `/api/auth/register`
- Redirect to sign-in on success

### Bottom Of Sidebar

- Display user avatar (Google image or initials fallback)
- Display user name
- Dropdown/up on avatar click with "Sign out" link
- Clicking on the icon should go to "/profile"

## Notes

### Avatar Logic

- If user has `image` (from Google): use that
- Otherwise: generate initials from name (e.g., "Brad Traversy" → "BT")

### Initials Component

Create a reusable avatar component that handles both cases.

## Testing

1. Go to `/sign-in` - verify custom page renders
2. Sign in with Google - verify flow works
3. Sign in with email/password - verify flow works
4. Verify avatar shows in top bar (Google image or initials)
5. Click avatar - verify dropdown appears
6. Click "Sign out" - verify logout and redirect
7. Go to `/register` - create new account - verify redirect to sign-in
